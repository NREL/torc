Usage
#####

The ``torc`` CLI toolkit provides the simplest mechanism to build and manage workflows. It
provides most functionality and this section describes it. If you need or want more control, you
are welcome to use the API through Swagger-generated libaries or API tools like ``curl``, `Postman
<https://www.postman.com/>`_, and `Insomnia <https://insomnia.rest/>`_. You can also use Arango
tools to manage data directly in the database.
