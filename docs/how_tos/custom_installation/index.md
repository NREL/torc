# Custom Database Installation

This section describes how to setup an instance of ArangoDB if you don't have access to an existing
database or prefer to manage the database yourself.

If you are developing new code for torc, you will likely want to use a local installation.

```{toctree}
:hidden: true
:maxdepth: 2

db_installation_local
db_installation_eagle
```
