# Security Reference

This document describes Torc's security features, threat model, and best practices for secure
deployments.

## Authentication & Authorization

### HTTP Basic Authentication

Torc uses HTTP Basic authentication with bcrypt password hashing.

**Security Properties:**

- ✅ Industry-standard authentication method
- ✅ Bcrypt hashing with configurable work factor (cost 4-31)
- ✅ No plaintext password storage
- ✅ Salt automatically generated per password
- ⚠️ Credentials sent base64-encoded (requires HTTPS)

**Architecture:**

```
Client Request
    ↓
[Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)]
    ↓
Server Middleware
    ↓
Extract credentials → Verify against htpasswd file (bcrypt)
    ↓
Success: Add username to request context
Failure: Return None authorization (logged)
    ↓
API Handler (receives authorization context)
```

### Authentication Modes

| Mode         | Configuration                | Behavior                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Disabled** | No `--auth-file`             | All requests allowed, no authentication           |
| **Optional** | `--auth-file` only           | Valid credentials logged, invalid/missing allowed |
| **Required** | `--auth-file --require-auth` | Invalid/missing credentials rejected              |

**Recommendation:** Use **Required** mode in production.

## Transport Security

### HTTPS/TLS

**When to use HTTPS:**

- ✅ **Always** when authentication is enabled
- ✅ When transmitting sensitive workflow data
- ✅ Over untrusted networks (internet, shared networks)
- ✅ Compliance requirements (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc.)

**Configuration:**

```bash
# Server
torc-server run --https --auth-file /etc/torc/htpasswd

# Client
torc --url https://torc.example.com/torc-service/v1 workflows list
```

**TLS Version:** Torc uses the system's OpenSSL/native-tls library. Ensure:

- TLS 1.2 minimum (TLS 1.3 preferred)
- Strong cipher suites enabled
- Valid certificates from trusted CA

### Network Security

**Deployment Patterns:**

**Pattern 1: Internal Network Only**

```
[Torc Clients] ←→ [Torc Server]
    (Trusted internal network)
```

- May use HTTP if network is truly isolated
- Still recommend HTTPS for defense in depth

**Pattern 2: Load Balancer with TLS Termination**

```
[Torc Clients] ←HTTPS→ [Load Balancer] ←HTTP→ [Torc Server]
    (Internet)              (Internal trusted network)
```

- TLS terminates at load balancer
- Internal traffic may use HTTP
- Ensure load balancer validates certificates

**Pattern 3: End-to-End TLS**

```
[Torc Clients] ←HTTPS→ [Torc Server]
    (Internet or untrusted network)
```

- Most secure pattern
- TLS all the way to Torc server
- Required for compliance scenarios

### Internal Network Quick Setup

For internal, trusted networks where the primary goal is preventing accidental access rather than
defending against malicious attacks, use this optimized configuration:

```bash
# 1. Create htpasswd with lower cost factor (faster auth)
torc-htpasswd add --cost 8 /etc/torc/htpasswd alice
torc-htpasswd add --cost 8 /etc/torc/htpasswd bob

# 2. Run server with auth and access control
torc-server run \
  --auth-file /etc/torc/htpasswd \
  --require-auth \
  --enforce-access-control \
  --credential-cache-ttl-secs 60
```

This provides:

- User isolation (users only see their own workflows)
- Fast CLI response (~10ms first auth, <1ms cached)
- Protection against accidental modifications
- Simple username/password authentication

For higher security requirements (internet-facing, compliance, sensitive data), use the default cost
factor (12) and HTTPS.

## Credential Management

### Password Requirements

**Recommendations:**

- Minimum 12 characters
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- No dictionary words or common patterns
- Unique per user and environment

**Bcrypt Cost Factor:**

| Cost | Approx Time | Use Case                                  |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 4    | ~1ms        | Testing only                              |
| 8    | ~10ms       | Internal trusted networks                 |
| 10   | ~50ms       | Low-security internal                     |
| 12   | ~250ms      | **Default**, general use, internet-facing |
| 14   | ~1s         | High security, sensitive data             |
| 15+  | > 2s        | Maximum security, infrequent logins       |

**Cost Selection Criteria:**

- Higher cost = more CPU, slower login
- Balance security vs. user experience
- Consider attack surface (internet-facing vs. internal)
- For internal networks with trusted users, cost 8 provides reasonable security with fast response

**Creating passwords with a specific cost:**

```bash
# Default cost (12) - good for most deployments
torc-htpasswd add /etc/torc/htpasswd alice

# Lower cost (8) - faster, suitable for internal networks
torc-htpasswd add --cost 8 /etc/torc/htpasswd alice

# Higher cost (14) - slower, for high-security environments
torc-htpasswd add --cost 14 /etc/torc/htpasswd alice
```

### Credential Caching

To improve CLI responsiveness, the server caches successful authentications for a configurable
duration (default: 60 seconds). This avoids repeated bcrypt verification for the same credentials.

**Configuration:**

```bash
# CLI option
torc-server run --credential-cache-ttl-secs 60

# Environment variable
export TORC_CREDENTIAL_CACHE_TTL_SECS=60

# Config file (torc.toml)
[server]
credential_cache_ttl_secs = 60
```

**Performance impact:**

| Scenario               | Response Time |
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| First auth (cost 12)   | ~250ms        |
| First auth (cost 8)    | ~10ms         |
| Cached auth (any cost) | < 1ms         |

**Security notes:**

- Passwords are never stored in plaintext in the cache
- Cache keys are SHA-256 hashes of credentials
- Cache entries auto-expire after TTL
- Failed authentications are never cached
- Set `--credential-cache-ttl-secs 0` to disable caching

### Htpasswd File Security

**File Permissions:**

```bash
# Restrict to server process owner only
chmod 600 /etc/torc/htpasswd
chown torc-server:torc-server /etc/torc/htpasswd
```

**Storage Best Practices:**

- ❌ Never commit to version control
- ❌ Never share between environments
- ✅ Store in secure configuration management (Ansible Vault, HashiCorp Vault)
- ✅ Backup with encryption
- ✅ Rotate regularly (quarterly recommended)

**File Format Security:**

```
# Comments allowed
username:$2b$12$hash...
```

- Only bcrypt hashes accepted (`$2a$`, `$2b$`, or `$2y$`)
- No plaintext passwords
- No MD5, SHA-1, or weak hashes

### Client Credential Storage

**Best Practices:**

| Method                    | Security   | Use Case                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Environment variables** | ⭐⭐⭐     | Scripts, automation, CI/CD     |
| **Password prompt**       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Interactive sessions           |
| **Config files**          | ⭐         | Not recommended                |
| **Command-line args**     | ⚠️          | Visible in process list, avoid |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Good: Environment variables
read -s TORC_PASSWORD && export TORC_PASSWORD
torc workflows list

# Good: Password prompt
torc alice workflows list
Password: ****

# Acceptable: CI/CD with secrets
TORC_PASSWORD=${{ secrets.TORC_PASSWORD }} torc workflows create

# Bad: Command-line argument (visible in `ps`)
torc --password mypassword workflows list
```

## Threat Model

### Threats Mitigated

| Threat                          | Mitigation                        | Effectiveness  |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Unauthorized API access**     | Required authentication           | ✅ High        |
| **Credential stuffing**         | Bcrypt work factor, rate limiting | ✅ Medium-High |
| **Password cracking**           | Bcrypt (cost ≥12)                 | ✅ High        |
| **Man-in-the-middle**           | HTTPS/TLS                         | ✅ High        |
| **Credential theft (database)** | No plaintext storage, bcrypt      | ✅ High        |

### Threats Not Mitigated

| Threat                   | Impact | Recommendation                         |
| ------------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **DDoS attacks**         | High   | Use rate limiting, firewalls, CDN      |
| **SQL injection**        | Medium | Use parameterized queries (Torc does)  |
| **Insider threats**      | High   | Audit logging, least privilege         |
| **Compromised client**   | High   | Network segmentation, monitoring       |
| **Side-channel attacks** | Low    | Constant-time operations (bcrypt does) |

### Attack Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Compromised htpasswd file**

**Impact:** Attacker has password hashes

**Risk:** Medium - Bcrypt makes cracking difficult

**Mitigation:**

1. Immediately revoke all user accounts
2. Generate new htpasswd file with fresh passwords
3. Investigate how file was compromised
4. Increase bcrypt cost if needed

**Scenario 2: Leaked credentials in logs**

**Impact:** Credentials in plaintext in logs

**Risk:** High

**Prevention:**

- Never log passwords
- Sanitize logs before sharing
- Restrict log access

**Response:**

1. Rotate affected credentials immediately
2. Audit all log access
3. Review code for password logging

**Scenario 3: Network eavesdropping (HTTP)**

**Impact:** Credentials intercepted in transit

**Risk:** Critical over untrusted networks

**Prevention:**

- **Always use HTTPS** when authentication is enabled
- Especially critical for internet-facing deployments

**Response:**

1. Enable HTTPS immediately
2. Rotate all credentials (assume compromised)
3. Review access logs for suspicious activity

## Audit & Monitoring

### Authentication Events

**Server logs authentication events:**

```
# Successful authentication
DEBUG torc::server::auth: User 'alice' authenticated successfully

# Failed authentication (wrong password)
WARN torc::server::auth: Authentication failed for user 'alice'

# Missing credentials when required
WARN torc::server::auth: Authentication required but no credentials provided

# No authentication configured
DEBUG torc::server::auth: No authentication configured, allowing request
```

### Recommended Monitoring

**Metrics to track:**

1. Failed authentication attempts (per user, total)
2. Successful authentications (per user)
3. Requests without credentials (when auth enabled)
4. Unusual access patterns (time, volume, endpoints)

**Alerting thresholds:**

- 5+ failed attempts from same user in 5 minutes
- 100+ failed attempts total in 1 hour
- Authentication from unexpected IP ranges
- Access during unusual hours (if applicable)

**Log aggregation:**

```bash
# Collect auth events
grep "torc::server::auth" /var/log/torc-server.log

# Count failed attempts per user
grep "Authentication failed" /var/log/torc-server.log | \
  awk '{print $(NF)}' | sort | uniq -c

# Monitor in real-time
tail -f /var/log/torc-server.log | grep "WARN.*auth"
```

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR / Privacy

**User data in htpasswd:**

- Usernames may be personal data (email addresses)
- Password hashes are not personal data (irreversible)

**Recommendations:**

- Allow users to request account deletion
- Don't use email addresses as usernames (use aliases)
- Document data retention policies

### PCI-DSS / SOC2

**Requirements that apply:**

1. **Transport encryption:** Use HTTPS
2. **Access control:** Enable required authentication
3. **Password complexity:** Enforce strong passwords
4. **Audit logging:** Enable and monitor auth logs
5. **Regular reviews:** Audit user accounts quarterly

**Configuration:**

```bash
# PCI-DSS compliant setup
torc-server run \
  --https \
  --auth-file /etc/torc/htpasswd \
  --require-auth \
  --log-level info
```

## Access Control

### Admin Group

Torc uses a special **admin** group to control who can manage access groups. Key properties:

- **Config-driven**: Admin users are configured via `--admin-user` flag or `admin_users` config
- **Auto-created**: The admin group is created/synced automatically on server startup
- **System group**: Cannot be deleted or have membership modified via the API
- **Required for management**: Only admin members can create, delete, or modify access groups

**Configuration:**

```bash
# Via CLI
torc-server run --admin-user alice --admin-user bob --enforce-access-control

# Via config file
[server]
admin_users = ["alice", "bob"]
enforce_access_control = true
```
