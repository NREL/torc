# How to Cancel a Workflow

Stop a running workflow and terminate its jobs.

## Cancel a Workflow

```bash
torc workflows cancel <workflow_id>
```

This:

- Marks the workflow as canceled
- Stops claiming new jobs
- Sends SIGKILL to all running processes
- Sends `scancel` to all active or pending Slurm allocations

## Check Cancellation Status

Verify the workflow was canceled:

```bash
torc workflows status <workflow_id>
```

Or check completion status:

```bash
torc workflows is-complete <workflow_id>
```

Output:

```
Workflow 42 completion status:
  Is Complete: true
  Is Canceled: true
```

## Restart After Cancellation

To resume a canceled workflow:

```bash
# Reinitialize to reset canceled jobs
torc workflows reinitialize <workflow_id>

# Run again
torc workflows run <workflow_id>
torc workflows submit <workflow_id>
```

Jobs that completed before cancellation remain completed.
