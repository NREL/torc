# OOM Auto-Recovery Test Workflow
#
# This workflow tests the automatic OOM recovery feature of `torc watch --auto-recover`.
#
# Setup:
# - 5 work jobs that each request 10GB memory and 10 CPUs
# - Each job runs a script that attempts to allocate 30GB of memory
# - This will cause OOM failures since the jobs only request 10GB
#
# Test procedure:
# 1. Submit the workflow: torc submit-slurm --account <account> workflow.yaml
# 2. Watch with auto-recover: torc watch <workflow_id> --auto-recover
# 3. Jobs will fail with OOM, watcher increases memory (10GB -> 15GB -> 22GB -> 33GB)
# 4. Eventually jobs get enough memory and succeed
#
# Note: The debug partition typically has nodes with 256GB memory, so this should work.
